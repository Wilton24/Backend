        A cloud weighs around a million tonnes. A cloud typically has a volume
        of around 1km3 and a density of around 1.003kg per m3 - that's a density
        that’s around 0.4 per cent lower than the air surrounding it

        Identical twins don’t have the same fingerprints. You can’t blame your
        crimes on your twin, after all. This is because environmental factors
        during development in the womb (umbilical cord length, position in the
        womb, and the rate of finger growth) impact your fingerprint.

        Earth’s rotation is changing speed. It's actually slowing. This means
        that, on average, the length of a day increases by around 1.8 seconds
        per century. 600 million years ago a day lasted just 21 hours.

        Your brain is constantly eating itself. This process is called
        phagocytosis, where cells envelop and consume smaller cells or molecules
        to remove them from the system. Don’t worry! Phagocytosis isn't harmful,
        but actually helps preserve your grey matter.

        The world’s oldest cat lived to 38 years and three days old. Creme Puff
        was the oldest cat to ever live.
